    This example is part of a [suite of examples][examples] showing the
    different ways you can use [Skupper][website] to connect services
    across cloud providers, data centers, and edge sites.

next_steps: |
    Check out the other [examples][examples] on the Skupper website.
about_this_example: |
    This example was produced using [Skewer][skewer], a library for
    documenting and testing Skupper examples.

    [skewer]: https://github.com/skupperproject/skewer

    Skewer provides utility functions for generating the README and
    running the example steps.  Use the `./plano` command in the project
    root to see what is available.

    To quickly stand up the example using Minikube, try the `./plano demo`
    command.
