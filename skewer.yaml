title: Trade Zoo
subtitle: A simple trading application that runs in the public cloud but keeps its data in a private Kafka cluster
github_actions_url: https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-trade-zoo/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a simple Kafka application that shows how you can
  use Skupper to access a Kafka cluster at a remote site without
  exposing it to the public internet.

  It contains four services:

  * A Kafka cluster running in a private data center.  The cluster has
    two topics, "orders" and "updates".

  * An order processor running in the public cloud.  It consumes from
    "orders", matching buy and sell offers to make trades.  It
    publishes new and updated orders and trades to "updates".

  * A market data service running in the public cloud.  It looks at
    the completed trades and computes the latest and average prices,
    which it then publishes to "updates".

  * A web frontend service running in the public cloud.  It submits
    buy and sell orders to "orders" and consumes from "updates" in
    order to show what's happening.

  To set up the Kafka cluster, this example uses the Kubernetes
  operator from the [Strimzi][strimzi] project.  The other services
  are small Python programs.

  The example uses two Kubernetes namespaces, "private" and "public",
  to represent the private data center and public cloud.

  - title: Deploy the Kafka cluster
    preamble: |
      In the private namespace, use the `kubectl create` and `kubectl
      apply` commands with the listed YAML files to install the
      operator and deploy the cluster and topic.
    commands:
      private:
        - run: kubectl create -f kafka-cluster/strimzi.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f kafka-cluster/cluster1.yaml
        - run: kubectl wait --for condition=ready --timeout 540s kafka/cluster1
  - title: Expose the Kafka cluster
    preamble: |
      In the private namespace, use `skupper expose` with the
      `--headless` option to expose the Kafka cluster as a headless
      service on the Skupper network.

      Then, in the public namespace, use `kubectl get services` to
      check that the `cluster1-kafka-brokers` service appears after a
      moment.
    commands:
      private:
        - run: skupper expose statefulset/cluster1-kafka --headless --port 9092
      public:
        - run: kubectl get services
          await: [service/cluster1-kafka-brokers]
  - title: Deploy the application services
    preamble: |
      In the public namespace, use the `kubectl apply` command with
      the listed YAML files to install the application services.
    commands:
      public:
        - run: kubectl apply -f order-processor/kubernetes.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f market-data/kubernetes.yaml
        - run: kubectl apply -f frontend/kubernetes.yaml
